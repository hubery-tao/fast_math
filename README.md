# fast_math
always inline math functions based on AVX-512 intrinsics

This is a small HPC project I wrote during my internship at Hengtai Securities (恒泰证券). 
To use fast_math functions, simply include `fast_math.h` in your GCC project.
You may need CPUs supporting AVX-512 instruction set and a relatively newer GCC compiler.
